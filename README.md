# Movie-Genre-Classification-
### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies movies into genres based on their plot descriptions.
This involves text-based classification, where movie plots are processed into numerical vectors and used to train predictive models.

### Task Details
- Work with text-based movie plot descriptions.

- Preprocess raw text into machine learning-friendly numerical vectors.

- Explore and apply various classifiers to determine the best fit for genre classification.

- Provide insights into feature importance and analyze model misclassifications.
